#  Ride-Hailing Demand Analysis (Power BI Project)

This project analyzes ride-booking data from a ride-hailing service to identify demand patterns, optimize operations, and improve customer experience using interactive Power BI dashboards.

##  Objective

To explore booking trends across time, location, and ride status to help ride-hailing companies:
- Predict peak hours and days
- Minimize cancellations
- Improve driver allocation and pricing strategies

##  Dataset Overview

- **File**: `booking - Sheet1.csv`
- **Features**:
  - `Booking_ID`
  - `Pickup_Location`, `Drop_Location`
  - `Date`, `Time`
  - `Ride_Status` (Completed, Cancelled, No-show)
  - `Fare_Amount`
  - `Driver_ID`

##  Tools Used

- **Power BI** – For data visualization
- **Microsoft Excel / CSV** – Dataset
- *(Optional)* Python or SQL – For preprocessing

##  Key Insights

- Peak demand observed between **7–9 AM** and **6–9 PM**.
- **City centers and business hubs** are the top pickup zones.
- Around **15% of rides were cancelled or no-shows**, mostly during peak hours.
- Fare values increase significantly during weekends due to surge pricing.

##  Dashboard Features

- Time-series analysis of ride trends
- Filters for date, location, ride status
- Heatmaps of high-demand pickup zones
- KPIs: Total bookings, cancellations, avg fare, etc.

## Outcome

This project provides actionable insights to:
- Optimize driver supply across high-demand areas
- Improve on-time pickup rates
- Adjust pricing models based on demand

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time ride data for live dashboards
- Use machine learning to forecast demand
- Include customer feedback analysis
